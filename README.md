# UrbanExplorer

UrbanExplorer is a web application for urban exploration and community sharing, developed using Next.js, MongoDB, and real-time communication tools. This project was developed as part of my studies.

The main idea behind it was to let users discover interesting places in cities, write blogs, share posts, and connect with other explorers.
